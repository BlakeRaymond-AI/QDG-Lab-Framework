QDG-Lab-Framework
=================

This code constitutes a control framework for the PAT experiment operated by the University of British Columbia Quantum Degenerate Gases
group under the supervision of Dr. Kirk Madison.

The PixeLinkController code was taken from another project within the lab. 
The OptimizerController makes use of the DEAP framework (https://code.google.com/p/deap/) for Particle Swarm Optimization.
All other code was written by Victor I. Barua during the summer of 2013.
